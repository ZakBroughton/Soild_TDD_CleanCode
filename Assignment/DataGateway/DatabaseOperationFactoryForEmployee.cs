    This class, DatabaseOperationFactoryForEmployee, showcases adherence to SOLID principles:
    - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by managing the creation of database operations (insertions and selections) for Employee entities.
    - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) by offering various methods for creating different selectors and inserters.
    
    Note: The code structure aligns with SRP and ISP by focusing on creation methods for specific database operations;
